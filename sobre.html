            <p>Hi! My name is Pedro and I am a data scientist and I have a masters (MSc.) in wind load modelling using computational fluid dynamics (CFD).</p>

            <p>I have experience in academic research with structural engineering as well as professional experience with data science and data analytics.</p>

            <p>I started implementing the Data/Analytics area in the first company I worked in, bringing mathematical and statistical models for pricing, market analysis and customer behaviour. Later, I introduced machine learning to solve company problems and generate value whithin the company.</p>

            <p>Nowadays I am working in a data science consulting startup, dealing both with customers as well as the development team, implementing new models in the infrastructure as well as refactoring previous R scripts to Python.</p>

            <p>In my free time, I am studying Deep Learning, both the implementation from scratch as well as with Tensorflow and PyTorch.</p>

            <p>My main programming language is Python, but I also work with R, SQL and Spark.</p>
